A few ground rules for people interested in adding new mime-types.

* Mime-types used should be IANA registered mime-types when possible
* When old mime-types become registered, the new definition should
  include an alias for the old mime-type
* New entries or modifications should include a test case (see below)
* Mime-types/file formats proprietary to one application should only
  be added to a private .xml file and be bundled with the application
  itself
* No commits should be done that break the test suite, or the test suite
  test in question should be amended, and reason for the changes clearly
  documented in the ChangeLog

Translations
------------

Translations should go through the Translation Project at:
http://translationproject.org/latest/shared-mime-info/

More details at:
http://translationproject.org/html/maintainers.html

CVS
---

Check it out using:
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/mime login
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@anoncvs.freedesktop.org:/cvs/mime co shared-mime-info

Filing bugs
-----------

Bugs can be filed at:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=shared-mime-info

Bugs for new mime-types should include:
- a patch generated against the current CVS, with the "-up" arguments for CVS
- one or more test files to be added to the test suite

Test suite
----------

You need to have xdgmime checked out and compile at the same level as
shared-mime-info. ../xdgmime/src/test-mime-data will be run against
tests/list.

The format of the file is:
<testcase filename> <expected mime-type> <expected failures>

The expected failures is whether matching the file with the mime-type would
fail when matched by file, data or name. "x" indicates expected failure, "o"
indicates expected success. Trailing "o"s can be omitted.

Releasing
---------

Before release, an updated shared-mime-info.pot is sent to
<coordinator@translationproject.org> so the translators have a chance
of updating the translations before release.

The mail should be in form:
Subject: shared-mime-info-version.pot
Body: URL to shared-mime-info tarball

Updated .po files are sent to <shared-mime-info-maint@freedesktop.org>

To pull translations from the Translation Project website, use:
make update-translations

Updating the spec on the website
--------------------------------

- On gabe, go in /srv/specifications.freedesktop.org/www
- Edit specs.idx
- Run ../update.py
